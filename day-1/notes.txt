 ~ 3 Vs of BIG DATA 

 1. Volume -> PB , MB , ZB , KB , TB, EB 
 2. Variety -> Sturcture, Un-structure , Semi structure
 3. Velocity -> batch , Near-time , Stream 
 4. Veracity -> Trust in terms of Accuracy
 5. Value    -> what is value of the data / USECASE (likes,posts,stories [FOR SEGREGATION])
 Big data is having above 5 Vs - Volume , Variety , Velocity , Veracity , Value
